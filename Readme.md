# Project 4 Team 3

### Team Members: Anthony Noreska, Eduardo Castro, Hanns Peter Princivil, and Joshua Modina

## Project Overview:

The project aims to analyse gaming trends and predict user engagement metrics and genre preferences using machine learning techniques. The analysis will include regional mapping of popular game genres and prediction of user engagement bases on various game features. 

## Project Components:

### Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Utilise the Steam API and other relevant sources to collect data on game titles, genres, ratings, reviews, prices, player counts, release years, and developer/publisher information.
Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, normalise numeric features.

### Regional Leaflet Map for Top 10/Genre:
Enhance the existing website with functionality to display an interactive Leaflet map.
Plot the top 10 games or popular genres for each region on the map based on user preferences and engagement metrics.
Implement user-driven interaction features such as dropdown menus or checkboxes to allow users to explore different regions and genres.

### User Engagement Prediction:
Train supervised machine learning models to predict user engagement metrics such as playtime, peak playing hours.
Use features such as game tags, type, number of players to train the models.
Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics and fine-tune them for better accuracy.

### Genre Preference Analysis:
Apply supervised machine learning algorithms to analyse user preferences for different game genres.
Train classification models using features such as game attributes, ratings, reviews, price, and historical gameplay data to predict preferred genres.
Evaluate the models' performance in predicting genre preferences and identify key factors influencing genre selection.
Dashboard Development and Visualization:
Build upon our existing dashboard interface to visualize the analysis results and predictions
